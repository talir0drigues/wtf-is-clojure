# wtf-is-clojure

A simple introduction to clojure.
Please, be aware that some branchs are not in english, since it can be redirect to specific groups of people. 
The goal is to democratize the knowledge, always.

### Everything here is a compile of:

- My own path to learn clojure at [nubank](https://nubank.com.br/en/)
- [Programing clojure](https://pragprog.com/titles/shcloj3/programming-clojure-third-edition/) in my humble opinion is the best of for ppl that come from Java and OO world.
- [clojure for brave and true](https://www.braveclojure.com/)

## Usage

Feel free to fork, learn, experiment. Clojure is a pretty powerfull language, the skies are the limit (or not) here.

Have fun ;)
